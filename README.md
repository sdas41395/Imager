Fluorscence Imager UIR and Algorithms. Strictly for Lab use. Old code. Needs organization and modifying. General purpose of code structure and algorithms explained in comments of either the main cws code or functions

To view:
1) .cws (Whole project code with saved dates)
  -Includes initialize and flow of experiment. Fully commented.<br>
2) PSBP / PS* = Lambda Power Supply control<br>
3) Tables = Data tables manager/interacting with experiment controls<br>
4) SaveandOpen = saving raw image files with relevant information
5) FluorImg.h = Data Structures for Experiment Controls

Note that to open this project it must be contained in National Instruments CV Windows.
